## Geyser on Bungeecord
If you are using Geyser on Bungeecord Make sure you installed FloodgateAPI on both Bungeecord and spigot server.
Copy file `key.pem` in the FloodgateAPI folder on Bungeecord to the FloodgateAPI folder on the Spigot server.
```yaml
#plugins/floodgate/config.yml

send-floodgate-data: true
```
