Make sure you have [FloodgateAPI](https://geysermc.org/download) and [Kotlin-stdlib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/kotlin-stdlib.80808/) installed. So here is the guide after you have these 2 plugins installed

## Geyser on Bungeecord
If you are using Geyser on Bungeecord Make sure you installed FloodgateAPI on both Bungeecord and spigot server.

```yaml
#plugins/floodgate/config.yml

send-floodgate-data: true
```

## License Key
This section contains the license key, which you can get in from our Discord after purchased the plugin and verified. The plugin requires the license key to activate.
